## Why Allura?

AI agents forget. Sessions end, context evaporates, and your team's hard-won knowledge disappears into the void.

Allura gives your agents **persistent, inspectable memory** — not a black box that silently decides what matters. Every memory is captured, scored, and routed through a clear pipeline where human judgment stays in the loop.

**Allura is for teams that want:**
- 🔍 **Inspectability** — trace what was recorded, when, and why it was promoted
- 🏛️ **Governance** — approval gates between raw capture and long-term knowledge
- 🔒 **Self-hosting** — your data, your infrastructure, your rules
- 🧩 **MCP-native** — plug into Claude, Cursor, OpenCode, or any MCP-compatible agent

---

## Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="public/readme/readme-allura-brain.png" alt="Allura Brain Architecture" width="720" />
</p>

Allura uses a **dual-layer memory architecture** — two purpose-built stores, each doing what it does best:

| Layer | Store | Role | Write Pattern |
|-------|-------|------|---------------|
| **Episodic** | PostgreSQL | Raw event capture, audit trail, high-volume traces | Append-only |
| **Semantic** | Neo4j | Curated knowledge, versioned relationships, promotion-gated | Review → Promote |

**The rule:** Every memory starts in PostgreSQL. Knowledge moves to Neo4j only after scoring and (optionally) curator review. History is never overwritten — superseded nodes are deprecated, not deleted.

### Memory Flow

<p align="center">
  <img src="public/readme/readme-memory-flow.png" alt="Memory Flow" width="640" />
</p>

```
Agent writes memory
  ↓
PostgreSQL stores append-only event (episodic layer)
  ↓
Content is scored (0–1 confidence)
  ↓
┌─ score < threshold → stays episodic (retrievable, not promoted)
└─ score ≥ threshold → enters review queue
      ↓
  Curator approves or rejects
      ↓
  Approved → promoted to Neo4j (semantic layer)
  Rejected → stays episodic with audit record
```

### Vector Search

Allura embeds every memory at write time using **Qwen3 Matryoshka embeddings** (1024d) via Ollama. Queries use **hybrid ANN + BM25 ranking** through pgvector HNSW indexes for semantic retrieval across both stores.

## Features

<p align="center">
  <img src="public/readme/infographic.png" alt="Feature Overview" width="640" />
</p>

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Dual-layer storage** | PostgreSQL (episodic) + Neo4j (semantic) with clear promotion boundary |
| **Append-only audit trail** | Every write is an immutable event — reconstruct any point in time |
| **Human-in-the-loop curation** | Score-gated review queue before knowledge promotion |
| **Multi-tenant isolation** | `group_id`-based boundaries at the schema level |
| **MCP protocol native** | Stdio + Streamable HTTP gateway for any MCP-compatible agent |
| **Vector search** | RuVector (episodic) + Neo4j (semantic) via hybrid ANN + BM25 ranking |
| **Plugin harness** | MCP server discovery, approval, and routing |
| **Self-hostable** | Docker Compose or Kubernetes — auth dependency: Clerk |
| **Versioned knowledge** | `SUPERSEDES` relationships in Neo4j — old facts are deprecated, not erased |

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** + Docker Compose
- **Bun** 1.0+
- **Ollama** (for local embeddings — pull `qwen3-embedding:8b`)

### 1. Clone & Configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Charitablebusinessronin/Allura_Memory.git
cd Allura_Memory
bun install

cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database credentials and JWT secret
```

### 2. Start Infrastructure

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This brings up PostgreSQL, Neo4j, and the Allura Brain HTTP gateway.

### 3. Verify

The MCP HTTP gateway runs on port **3201** by default. Check availability:

```bash
# MCP Streamable HTTP endpoint (primary integration path)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3201/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":1}'

# Health check (MCP HTTP gateway)
curl http://localhost:3201/health
# → { "status": "healthy", "interface": "mcp-http", "transports": ["streamable-http"], ... }

# Liveness check (process heartbeat)  
curl http://localhost:3201/live
# → { "alive": true, "uptime": 123.45, "timestamp": "2026-04-20..." }

# Readiness check (PostgreSQL, Neo4j, MCP initialized)
curl http://localhost:3201/ready
# → { "ready": true, ... }
```

### 4. Connect Your Agent

Add to your MCP client config (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.):

**Stdio:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "allura": {
      "command": "bun",
      "args": ["src/mcp/memory-server-canonical.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

**HTTP Gateway:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "allura": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3201/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Use the Tools

All memory operations require `group_id` and `user_id` for multi-tenant isolation.

```typescript
// Store a memory
memory_add({
  group_id: "allura-myteam",
  user_id: "alice",
  content: "Alice prefers dark mode for all UIs",
  metadata: {
    source: "conversation"
  },
  threshold: 0.85
})

// Search memories
memory_search({
  query: "dark mode preferences",
  group_id: "allura-myteam",
  user_id: "alice"
})

// Retrieve a specific memory
memory_get({
  id: "mem_7f9e2c3a1b5d",
  group_id: "allura-myteam"
})

// List all memories for a user
memory_list({
  group_id: "allura-myteam",
  user_id: "alice"
})

// Delete (soft — recoverable within 30 days)
memory_delete({
  id: "mem_7f9e2c3a1b5d",
  group_id: "allura-myteam",
  user_id: "alice"
})
```

## Configuration

All configuration lives in `.env`:

```bash
# ── Core (all required in production) ───────────
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_DB=allura
POSTGRES_USER=allura
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<required — no default>
NEO4J_URI=neo4j://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=<required — no default>

# ── Governance ────────────────────────
PROMOTION_MODE=soc2          # "soc2" (review-gated) or "auto" (auto-promote)
AUTO_APPROVAL_THRESHOLD=0.85 # minimum score for promotion eligibility

# ── Security ──────────────────────────
JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)

# ── Embeddings ────────────────────────
EMBEDDING_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434  # Ollama
EMBEDDING_MODEL=qwen3-embedding:8b
```

### Promotion Modes

| Mode | Behavior | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| `soc2` | Score ≥ threshold → curator review queue | Production, audit-conscious teams |
| `auto` | Score ≥ threshold → automatic promotion | Development, experimentation |

> **Note:** `soc2` is an internal workflow label for a stricter review path. It does **not** imply current SOC 2 certification.

## Brand & Visual Direction

<p align="center">
  <img src="public/readme/readme-brand-system.png" alt="Brand System" width="640" />
</p>

Allura's visual language is **warm, magnetic, and clear** — designed to reward a closer look.

- **Warmth over cold utility** — softer palettes, rounded corners, breathing room
- **Magnetic clarity** — information hierarchy that draws the eye without shouting
- **Considered restraint** — every element earns its place
- **Grounded sophistication** — professional without being sterile

This isn't "magic AI." It's a more legible memory system with a more considered interface.

---

## Deployment

### Docker Compose (recommended for most teams)

```bash
docker compose up -d
curl http://localhost:3100/api/health/live
```

### Pull from GHCR

> **Note:** GHCR images are published from CI but not yet verified for standalone pull-deploy. Use `docker compose up -d` from source for the recommended path.

```bash
# Available but not yet verified for standalone deployment
docker pull ghcr.io/charitablebusinessronin/allura_memory:latest

## What We Claim — And What We Don't

**We do claim:**
- Dual-layer memory with traceable capture and promotion
- Append-only audit trail by design
- Human-in-the-loop curation as a first-class feature
- Self-hosted deployment on your infrastructure
- MCP-native integration

**We do not claim:**
- Current SOC 2 certification or banking-grade approval
- Zero hallucinations or flawless accuracy
- Autonomous truth without review
- Benchmark superiority unless specifically verified

Where the product is directional, we describe it as **designed to**, **built to support**, or **positioned to help** — never as a verified claim.

---

## Design Principles

Allura follows a Brooksian approach to system design:

1. **Conceptual integrity** — one coherent vision, not a patchwork of best practices
2. **Explicit approval** — no silent automation around what becomes knowledge
3. **Surgical team specialization** — each component does one thing well
4. **Separation of concerns** — episodic and semantic are architecturally distinct
5. **Append-only audit** — history is preserved, never overwritten
6. **No silver bullet** — essential complexity can't be wished away

> **Allura governs. Runtimes execute. Curators promote.**
