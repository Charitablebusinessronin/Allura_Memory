# Agent Directory

This file defines the **live agent surface** for the Team RAM OpenCode Harness,
restored on the **OAC Core + Allura Overlay** architecture.

## Architecture Principle

> **OAC Core:** Context-first, plan-first, validation-first.
> **Allura Overlay:** Team RAM personas, Brain memory, governance, HITL, Brooks orchestration.
> **Memory supplements context; it does not replace it.**

## Canonical Rule

The flat files in `.opencode/agent/` are the only live agent definitions in this repo.

## ContextScout First Gate (MANDATORY)

Every implementation task must follow this execution sequence:

```
User task
  ↓
① Scout loads local .opencode/context files
  ↓
② Scout searches Allura Brain for prior decisions/blockers
  ↓
③ Skill resolver identifies required skills
  ↓
④ Builder executes with loaded context + skills
  ↓
⑤ Validation passes before done
```

**No agent may skip step ①.** Ralph, Woz, and all builders must have Scout context
loaded before writing implementation code.

## Ralph Skill Gate (MANDATORY)

Ralph may not execute unless this gate passes:

```json
{
  "context_loaded": true,
  "context_files": [],
  "brain_memories_checked": true,
  "required_skills": [],
  "skills_loaded": [],
  "validation_commands": []
}
```

**Failure conditions (Ralph MUST refuse):**
- No Scout context loaded
- Missing required skill
- Stale context without acknowledgment
- Missing validation command

## Team RAM

| Agent | Persona | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Brooks | Frederick P. Brooks Jr. | Architecture and orchestration |
| Jobs | Steve Jobs | Intent gate and scope owner |
| Woz | Steve Wozniak | Primary builder |
| Scout | Utility role | Discovery and recon (ContextScout) |
| Pike | Rob Pike | Interface simplicity |
| Fowler | Martin Fowler | Refactor safety |
| Bellard | Fabrice Bellard | Deep diagnostics |
| Carmack | John Carmack | Performance |
| Knuth | Donald Knuth | Data and schema |
| Hightower | Kelsey Hightower | Infra and deployment |

## Team RAM as Overlay

Team RAM personas consume OAC context — they do not replace it.

- **Brooks** = architecture/orchestration (consumes context/system/, context/workflows/)
- **Scout** = ContextScout + Brain retrieval (consumes context/core/, Brain search)
- **Woz** = builder (consumes context/development/, standards/)
- **Pike** = interface review (consumes context/ui/, design-systems/)
- **Fowler** = refactor gate (consumes context/core/workflows/code-review/)
- **Knuth** = data/schema (consumes context/development/data/)
- **Hightower** = infra (consumes context/development/infrastructure/)
- **Bellard/Carmack** = diagnostics/performance (consumes context/core/standards/)

## Skill Assignment Matrix

| Owner / Path | Required skills | Optional / routed skills | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| All agents | `allura-memory-skill` | `systematic-debugging`, `code-review` | Memory governance is mandatory. |
| Brooks | `party-mode`, `skill-creator`, `mcp-harness` | `task-creator`, UI/design skills for routing | Brooks orchestrates; he routes, doesn't hoard. |
| Scout | `allura-memory-skill`, `multi-search`, `perplexica-mcp`, `mcp-docker` | `context7` via MCP Docker | Scout owns Brain/search recon and context discovery. |
| Woz | `frontend-craft`, `shadcn`, `task-management`, `varlock`, `code-review` | `frontend-design` when implementing approved UI | Woz builds with loaded context. |
| Design/UI path | `frontend-design`, `frontend-craft`, `allura-design`, `huashu-design`, `shadcn` | `allura-memory-skill` for brand/context | Applies to UI/design agents. |
| Hightower | `mcp-docker`, `mcp-harness`, `varlock` | `perplexica-mcp` for infra research | Hightower owns deployability and secrets. |

## Execution Rule

**Scout before build. Skills before Ralph. Validate before done.**
