## Decision: Dual-Database Architecture (PostgreSQL + Neo4j)

**Date:** 2026-01-12  
**Status:** Decided  
**Owner:** Brooks (architect)

### Context
allura needs both an immutable audit trail and fast semantic search. A single database forces a trade-off between write-once reliability and query-time flexibility.

### Decision
PostgreSQL 16 for episodic append-only traces. Neo4j 5.26 for versioned semantic knowledge graph. Both run in the same Docker Compose stack.

### Rationale
- Postgres = truth: append-only events table, no UPDATE/DELETE ever
- Neo4j = speed: APOC-powered graph queries, semantic search, SUPERSEDES versioning
- Two stores enable HITL governance: raw trace → curator review → approved knowledge

### Alternatives Considered
| Alternative | Pros | Cons | Why Rejected |
|-------------|------|------|--------------|
| Single Postgres | Simpler ops | No native graph queries, no semantic versioning | Kills semantic search quality |
| Single Neo4j | Graph-native | No append-only guarantee, harder audit compliance | Mutability risk for audit trail |

### Impact
- **Positive:** Audit + semantic precision coexist; SOC2-ready by default
- **Negative:** Two DB services to operate; more complex dev setup
- **Risk:** Schema drift between PG and Neo4j (mitigated by curator pipeline)

## Decision: HITL Governance (SOC2 Mode)

**Date:** 2026-01-12  
**Status:** Decided  
**Owner:** Brooks

### Context
Enterprise customers require proof that AI agents cannot autonomously modify canonical knowledge. Without a human gate, allura is indistinguishable from any other memory store.

### Decision
`PROMOTION_MODE=soc2` routes high-confidence proposals to a pending queue. No Neo4j write happens until a curator explicitly approves. `PROMOTION_MODE=auto` available for developer tier.

### Rationale
- Governance = differentiator vs mem0 (which has no approval flow)
- Append-only Postgres preserves all proposals for audit, regardless of approval
- `bun run curator:approve` / `bun run curator:reject` are the only sanctioned promotion paths

### Impact
- **Positive:** Enterprise compliance market; auditable knowledge lifecycle
- **Negative:** Adds latency for promoted knowledge in SOC2 mode
- **Risk:** Curators bottleneck if proposal volume spikes (mitigated by auto-promotion threshold)

## Decision: allura Name Casing

**Date:** 2026-04-24  
**Status:** Decided  
**Owner:** Brand (David Ogilvy persona)

### Context
Brand finalization required a consistent rule for how the product name appears in all copy.

### Decision
Always lowercase `allura` in running copy. `Allura Memory` in legal / title context only. Never `ALLURA`, never `The Allura`.

### Rationale
Phonoaesthetic: soft opening, liquid 'l', warm resonant tone. Lowercase reinforces approachability and warmth vs cold capitalized tech brands.

### Impact
- **Positive:** Consistent brand identity across all surfaces
- **Negative:** Agents and contributors must be reminded — easy to drift
- **Risk:** Template files or auto-capitalization may violate this (enforce with grep in CI if needed)

## Decision: Dashboard Course Correction (2026-04-25)

**Date:** 2026-04-25  
**Status:** Decided  
**Owner:** Brooks

### Context
A previous session erroneously cloned the Blazity/Vercel Next.js Enterprise Boilerplate into `apps/allura-dashboard`. The user's real working dashboard already existed at `src/app/(main)/dashboard` on `localhost:3100`.

### Decision
Remove `apps/allura-dashboard` (the mistaken scaffold). The canonical dashboard lives at `src/app/(main)/dashboard`. Port 3100 is the allura dashboard; it is NOT Paperclip.

### Rationale
Conceptual integrity: one dashboard, one codebase. The mistaken clone created a parallel surface with different assumptions (Paperclip port, external boilerplate deps) that contaminated the session context.

### Impact
- **Positive:** Single dashboard surface; no competing assumptions
- **Negative:** Lost the session exploring the boilerplate setup
- **Risk:** None — the real dashboard is preserved and unmodified

## Decision: MCP Docker CLI Check Opt-In

**Date:** 2026-04-25  
**Status:** Decided  
**Owner:** Brooks

### Context
`scripts/test-mcp-browser.ts` was conflating an optional external `mcp-docker` CLI status check with browser/dev-server validation. The repository aliases `@mcp-docker` imports to local Vitest mocks, so `bun x mcp-docker status` is not a normal prerequisite and caused false failures.

### Decision
Skip MCP Docker CLI check by default. Require `USE_REAL_MCP_DOCKER=true` env var to opt into real Docker MCP validation. Keep canonical Streamable HTTP test as the protocol gate.

### Rationale
Fewer confusing pre-conditions = cleaner developer experience. Protocol health is already validated by the dedicated Streamable HTTP integration test (12/12 passing).

### Impact
- **Positive:** `bun run test:mcp` gives actionable output without a running Docker MCP server
- **Negative:** Real Docker MCP integration requires explicit opt-in — slightly less default coverage
- **Risk:** Developers may forget `USE_REAL_MCP_DOCKER=true` for full integration testing

## Decision: Bun-Only Runtime

**Date:** 2026-01-12  
**Status:** Decided  
**Owner:** Sabir (user)

### Context
Zero-trust supply chain policy. npm/npx introduce risk via network-fetched executables and unpinned package resolution.

### Decision
Bun is the only permitted package manager and runtime. `npm`, `npx`, `pnpm`, `yarn` are banned.

### Rationale
Bun's lockfile model + supply chain isolation. Faster than Node for scripts. All CLAUDE.md instructions enforce this.

### Impact
- **Positive:** Reproducible installs; no npm supply chain exposure
- **Negative:** Some npm-only tools require alternatives or wrapping
- **Risk:** Contributors may accidentally run npm — catch with `bun run lint`

## Decision: Graph Visualization Library — react-force-graph-2d over NVL

**Date:** 2026-04-26  
**Status:** Decided  
**Owner:** Brooks

### Context
The allura dashboard Graph View (screen 03) requires interactive Neo4j graph visualization. Two primary candidates evaluated: `@neo4j-nvl/react` (official Neo4j library, powers Bloom/Aura) and `react-force-graph-2d` (MIT, open source, force-directed).

### Decision
Use `react-force-graph-2d` for the Graph View. Feed data from `/api/memory/graph` (already live). Dynamic import with `{ ssr: false }` for Next.js App Router compatibility.

### Rationale
- NVL license restricts commercial use beyond a threshold — Allura's SaaS roadmap makes this a liability
- `react-force-graph-2d` is MIT, no commercial restrictions
- Full canvas API control enables exact Allura brand color application per node type
- Dynamic import (`ssr: false`) is the established Next.js pattern for browser-only graph libs

### Alternatives Considered
| Alternative | Why Rejected |
|-------------|-------------|
| `@neo4j-nvl/react` | Commercial license restriction; upgrade path when/if needed |
| Cytoscape.js | Heavier, less React-native; no advantage for this use case |
| D3 force-directed | Lower-level; more custom work for same result |

### Impact
- **Positive:** MIT license, full brand control, lighter bundle
- **Negative:** Less out-of-box polish vs NVL; requires custom node canvas rendering
- **Risk:** Visual gap vs NVL's Bloom-quality styling (mitigated by brand-accurate custom rendering)

## Decision: Brand Identity Color Correction

**Date:** 2026-04-26  
**Status:** Decided  
**Owner:** Brooks

### Context
`BRAND-IDENTITY.md` contained an outdated color palette (Deep Navy `#1A2B4A`, Coral `#E85A3C`, etc.) and wrong typography (Outfit/Inter). The finalized brand guide delivered 2026-04-26 specifies entirely different values.

### Decision
Replace all color and typography values in context files with finalized brand guide values. IBM Plex Sans is the canonical font. Six brand colors are `#1D4ED8`, `#FF5A2E`, `#157A4A`, `#0F1115`, `#C89B3C`, `#F6F4EF`.

### Impact
- **Positive:** All agents now work from correct brand values; no color drift in generated components
- **Risk:** Any previously generated CSS using old hex values must be audited

## Deprecated Decisions

| Decision | Date | Replaced By | Why |
|----------|------|-------------|-----|
| `roninclaw-*` group_id namespace | 2026-01-12 | `allura-*` | Tenant namespace aligned to product name |
| Local allura-memory MCP server | 2026-04-19 | MCP_DOCKER tools | Docker-backed servers only; local MCP retired |
| apps/allura-dashboard (Vercel boilerplate) | 2026-04-25 | `src/app/(main)/dashboard` | Mistaken parallel scaffold; removed |
