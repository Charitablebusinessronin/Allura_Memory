**Total: 35 skills** — 6 Required (core gates), 29 Overlay (project-specific)

**Deleted / archived:**
- `systematic-debugging-memory` — archived to `.opencode/archive/skills-2026-05-07/`
- `executing-plans` — removed (orphan)
- `plugin-creator` — removed (orphan)
- `subagent-driven-development` — removed (orphan)
- `superpowers-memory` — removed (orphan)
- `trailofbits-audit` — removed (orphan)
- `writing-plans` — removed (orphan)
- `readme-memory` — removed (orphan)

**Ghost entries removed:**
- `penpot-design` — referenced in manifest but never on disk; removed from manifest.json
- `memory-client` — former name for `allura-memory-skill`; table standardized

**Special attention items:**
- `allura-memory-skill`: Mandatory for all agents. Cannot be removed without breaking Brain integration.
- `context7` + `multi-search`: Both serve Scout's discovery role. context7 for library docs, multi-search for web search. Complementary, not overlapping.
- `figma-*` skills: 6 Figma skills may seem excessive, but each serves a distinct Figma API surface. Keep all.
- `penpot-design`, `perplexica-search`, and `mcp-docker-ops`: Skill-embedded MCP pattern examples. They may declare/allow tools, but activation still requires mcp-harness governance.
- Ralph-related: `ralph.md` is a command, not a skill. Ralph's execution is gated by the ContextScout + skill gate (R5).
