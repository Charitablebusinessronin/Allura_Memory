# /skill-propose

Propose a skill and see which specialist agent handles it.

## Usage

```bash
/skill-propose <skill-name>
```

## Examples

```bash
/skill-propose code-review           # Code review specialist (@Pike)
/skill-propose postgres-optimization # Database specialist (@Woz)
/skill-propose system-design         # Architecture specialist (@Fowler)
```

## How It Works

1. Harness looks up skill in registry
2. Shows skill metadata: purpose, preferred executor, requirements
3. Logs `SKILL_PROPOSED` event to PostgreSQL
4. Shows next step: execute with `/skill-load`

## Result

```json
{
  "event": "SKILL_PROPOSED",
  "skill_name": "code-review",
  "executor": "pike",
  "description": "Read-only code review and architecture feedback",
  "requirements": ["Can read source files", "Cannot write code"]
}
```

**Note:** Only Brooks routes to specific executors. See `/skill-load`.
