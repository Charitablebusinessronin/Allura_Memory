Allura is a sovereign AI memory engine — a self-hosted, governed alternative to mem0.ai. It gives AI agents persistent, auditable, multi-tenant memory backed by a dual-database architecture (PostgreSQL for episodic traces, Neo4j for semantic knowledge). The system enforces tenant isolation, append-only history, and versioned knowledge at the schema level — not by policy.

## 1) Core Concepts

### Memory

A Memory is a unit of information an AI agent stores about a user, session, or context. Memories flow through two stores depending on their confidence score and the active promotion mode.

**States:** `episodic | semantic | deleted`

**Key fields:**

- `content` — the raw text of the memory
- `user_id` — the owner (scoped within a `group_id`)
- `group_id` — tenant namespace, must match `^allura-`
- `score` — confidence/relevance (0–1), determines promotion eligibility

---

### Episodic Memory (PostgreSQL)

Every memory write lands here first. Append-only. Never mutated. Provides the raw event log and audit trail.

**States:** `recorded` (terminal — no transitions)

**Key fields:**

- `event_type` — e.g. `memory_add`, `memory_delete`
- `metadata` — JSONB payload (content, query, score, etc.)
- `created_at` — immutable write timestamp

---

### Semantic Memory (Neo4j)

Promoted, curated knowledge. Versioned via `SUPERSEDES` relationships. Nodes are never edited — a new node is created that supersedes the prior one.

**States:** `active | deprecated`

**Key fields:**

- `id` — UUID
- `group_id` — tenant namespace
- `content` — memory content
- `score` — confidence score
- `deprecated` — true when a newer version exists

---

### Tenant (`group_id`)

The hard isolation boundary. Every read and write MUST include a valid `group_id`. Enforced by a PostgreSQL CHECK constraint (`group_id ~ '^allura-'`). No application-layer bypass is possible.

### Functional Requirements

#### Memory Operations

| #   | Requirement                                                                                                |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| F1  | `memory_add(content, userId, metadata?)` — writes to Postgres; conditionally promotes to Neo4j             |
| F2  | `memory_search(query, userId, limit?)` — federated search across Postgres + Neo4j, merged by relevance     |
| F3  | `memory_get(memoryId)` — returns a single memory record by ID                                              |
| F4  | `memory_list(userId)` — returns all memories for a user within the tenant                                  |
| F5  | `memory_delete(memoryId)` — soft-delete: appends a deletion event to Postgres, marks Neo4j node deprecated |

#### Governance

| #   | Requirement                                                                                    |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| F6  | `PROMOTION_MODE=soc2` — score ≥ threshold queues for human approval; no autonomous Neo4j write |
| F7  | `PROMOTION_MODE=auto` — score ≥ `AUTO_APPROVAL_THRESHOLD` promotes immediately to Neo4j        |
| F8  | `group_id` CHECK constraint blocks writes with invalid tenant namespaces                       |
| F9  | `SUPERSEDES` relationship created on every Neo4j node update                                   |

#### Curator Dashboard

| #   | Requirement                                                                                         |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| F10 | `POST /api/curator/score` — scores proposal, returns {confidence, reasoning, tier}                  |
| F11 | `POST /api/curator/approve` — moves proposal to approved knowledge, promotes to Neo4j if tier ≥ 85% |
| F12 | `POST /api/curator/reject` — archives proposal to 7-day undo, logs to audit trail                   |
| F13 | `GET /api/curator/proposals` — returns pending proposals (emerging + adoption tiers only)           |
| F14 | Curator dashboard shows three tabs: Traces (raw), Approved (knowledge), Pending (decisions)         |
| F15 | Pending tab sorts by confidence (descending); shows confidence badge + reasoning + buttons          |
| F16 | Approved tab shows all approved knowledge (human + auto-promoted); sortable by date/confidence      |
| F17 | Tab 1 restricted to authenticated users with `admin` role (engineers only)                          |
| F18 | Audit log endpoint: `GET /api/audit/events` — returns curator decisions with timestamps             |
| F19 | Dashboard integrates Clerk for authentication and RBAC (curator, admin, viewer roles)               |

#### Infrastructure

| #   | Requirement                                                                                 |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| F20 | Skills route agent work to packaged MCP servers (`neo4j-memory`, `database-server`, optional `neo4j-cypher`) rather than a custom all-in-one MCP runtime |
| F21 | `docker compose up` starts core infra and app services; packaged MCP servers are attached as focused external capabilities |
| F22 | Memory viewer UI at `/memory` lists, searches, and deletes memories                         |
| F23 | Curator dashboard deployed on Vercel; calls backend engine via `CURATOR_ENGINE_URL` env var |
| F24 | Vercel Functions (`/api/curator/*`) call Docker engine in VPC/cloud via HTTPS               |
| F25 | Error tracking: unhandled exceptions sent to Sentry; curator notified via email/Slack       |

#### Governed Memory Pipeline

| #   | Requirement                                                                                                          |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| F26 | Agent task lifecycle events, tool calls, outputs, retries, and terminal status are persisted as append-only traces    |
| F27 | Raw trace storage is append-only; no UPDATE or DELETE on the `events` table                                        |
| F28 | Raw traces preserve provenance linking downstream insights back to source evidence                                   |
| F29 | Curator reads raw traces and generates proposed insights (not active insights)                                     |
| F30 | Each proposed insight includes summary, evidence links, confidence score, timestamp, and status                    |
| F31 | Proposed insights enter an approval flow before becoming active knowledge                                           |
| F32 | Every approval, rejection, or policy decision is recorded as an audit event with actor and timestamp                |
| F33 | Approved insights are written to Neo4j as immutable nodes; no in-place updates                                     |
| F34 | Changed insights create new nodes linked with `SUPERSEDES`, `DEPRECATED`, or `REVERTED` relationships             |
| F35 | Agents retrieve knowledge through a controlled retrieval service, not by querying databases directly                 |
| F36 | Retrieval supports semantic and structured queries with project and global scope                                    |
| F37 | All knowledge-system reads/writes pass through controlled endpoints enforcing project-level access                  |
| F38 | Agent permissions enforced and all access to trace/knowledge resources is audited                                  |
| F39 | A second agent can retrieve approved knowledge and use it correctly in a later task                                |
| F40 | The full lifecycle from trace capture to knowledge reuse is traceable, auditable, and reversible                   |

## 5) Data Model

### `events` — PostgreSQL (Episodic Memory)

The primary append-only log. Every memory operation produces a row here. No UPDATE or DELETE ever.

| Field         | Type         | Required | Description                                                     |

---

## 6) Execution Rules

### Promotion Decision

1. Score the content using the memory engine scorer
2. Compare against `AUTO_APPROVAL_THRESHOLD` (default: 0.85)
3. If `score < threshold` → Postgres only, return
4. If `score >= threshold` AND `PROMOTION_MODE=auto` → promote to Neo4j immediately
5. If `score >= threshold` AND `PROMOTION_MODE=soc2` → insert into proposals table, return with `pending_review: true`

### Deduplication

Before any Neo4j write, search for an existing node with matching `content` + `group_id` + `user_id`. If found and `score` is within `DUPLICATE_THRESHOLD`, skip the write and return the existing node ID.

### Failure Semantics

- Postgres write failure → terminal error, return 500, nothing promoted
- Neo4j write failure → log to Postgres as `promotion_failed` event, return episodic-only result (non-fatal)
- Score computation failure → treat score as 0, write Postgres only

### Soft Delete

`memory_delete` never removes rows. It appends an event of type `memory_delete` to Postgres and sets `deprecated: true` on the Neo4j node (if promoted). The original rows remain for audit purposes.

---

## 7) Global Constraints

- **`group_id` MUST match `^allura-`** — enforced by PostgreSQL CHECK constraint. Failure is a schema error, not an application error.
- **Postgres rows are append-only** — no UPDATE or DELETE on the `events` table under any circumstance.
- **Neo4j nodes are immutable** — updates create a new node with a `SUPERSEDES` edge to the prior node.
- **Circuit breaker trips at budget threshold** — agent runaway is cut off at the infrastructure layer, not application layer.

## 8) API Surface

### MCP Tools (Agent Interface)

| `memory_search` | Semantic search across both stores |
| `memory_get`    | Fetch a single memory by ID        |
| `memory_list`   | List all memories for a user       |
| `memory_delete` | Soft-delete a memory               |

### REST API (Dashboard Interface)

| Method   | Path                            | Description          |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `POST`   | `/api/memory`                   | Add a memory         |

---

## 9) Logging & Audit

| What                   | Where stored           | Notes                                               |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Every memory operation | `events` (Postgres)    | Append-only, permanent                              |
| Promotion decisions    | `events` (Postgres)    | `event_type: memory_promoted` or `promotion_failed` |
| Search queries         | `events` (Postgres)    | Includes result count in metadata                   |
| Neo4j node versions    | Neo4j SUPERSEDES chain | Full lineage preserved                              |

**Redacted fields:** passwords, API keys, raw credentials must never appear in `metadata` JSONB.

---

## 9.5) Event-Driven Architecture

Allura's internal coordination is event-driven: every significant state change emits an event to the PostgreSQL `events` table. Consumers subscribe by querying `event_type`; producers insert rows. This design enables loose coupling between subsystems (curator, Notion sync, audit export, dashboard) while preserving the append-only audit trail.

### Event Types

| Event Type | Producer | Consumer(s) | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `memory_add` | `memory_add` tool / REST API | Retrieval layer, curator, dashboard | A memory was written to PostgreSQL |

## 10) Admin Workflow

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `NEO4J_PASSWORD`, `PROMOTION_MODE`
2. Run `docker compose up -d` — starts core infra and app services such as Postgres, Neo4j, and the web/API layer
3. Configure Team RAM skills to use packaged MCP servers such as `neo4j-memory` and `database-server`; add `neo4j-cypher` only for targeted graph inspection
4. Set `group_id` to your tenant namespace (e.g. `allura-myproject`)
5. Agents call `memory_add` / `memory_search` — memories flow automatically
6. Open `/memory` in the dashboard to inspect and manage memories

2. **Memory Layer:** PostgreSQL (episodic) + Neo4j (semantic)
3. **Governance Layer:** Optional curator dashboard for human approval

**Core Workflows:**

- Agent Task → Automatic Logging → PostgreSQL
- Claude Code Memory Commands → Team RAM skill routing → Focused MCP server calls
- Manual Insight Proposal → Pending queue → Neo4j (if approved)

## 12) Documentation Authority & Sync Contract

This section defines the single authority map between Notion templates/policy and repo implementation docs so agents never guess which surface owns truth.

### Authority Invariants

1. **Policy and templates are upstream in Notion.**
2. **Implementation canon is downstream in `docs/allura/` (exactly six files).**
3. **Agents do not auto-write repo content back to Notion template pages.**
4. **Canonical-now alignment:** PostgreSQL remains the append-only episodic evidence store, and Neo4j remains the canonical semantic knowledge graph. RuVector-derived capabilities may be adopted selectively for retrieval quality, witness receipts, and observability — but they do **not** replace canonical stores until a formal migration benchmark is approved.
5. **Residue** (reports, deliverables, ADR standalones, validation snapshots, benchmarks, prompts) goes to `docs/archive/allura/` or Allura Brain.

### Preflight Gate (mandatory before doc writes)

Before creating or updating documentation artifacts, agents must read this authority map and apply this check:

- If target is not one of the canonical six under `docs/allura/` and not an approved archive/memory destination, **abort and reroute**.
- No net-new file creation is allowed in `docs/allura/` beyond the canonical six.

## Appendix B: MCP Tool Reference

For Claude Code integration, Allura exposes three core tools via MCP:

### `memory_retrieve(query: string)`

**Purpose:** Search for memories

**Returns:**

```typescript
{
  episodic: string[],  // Raw traces from PostgreSQL
  semantic: string[],  // Approved facts from Neo4j
  count: number
}
```

**Use case:** Ask Claude Code "What's my coding style?" and get remembered patterns.

### `memory_write(event: string, metadata?: object)`

**Purpose:** Log an event to PostgreSQL

**Use case:** Claude Code auto-logs all tool calls. You can manually add context.

### `memory_propose_insight(title: string, statement: string)`

**Purpose:** Propose an insight for approval

**Use case:** You notice a pattern in your work, propose it explicitly for curator approval.
