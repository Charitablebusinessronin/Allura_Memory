/**
 * Bootstrap Fixtures for Allura M1
 *
 * Seeds 100 episodic traces, triggers curator scoring, and approves 5 insights
 * so that memory_search returns real approved data.
 *
 * Usage: bun scripts/bootstrap-fixtures.ts
 *
 * Prerequisites:
 * - PostgreSQL running with allura_memories table
 * - Neo4j running with schema applied
 * - MCP server environment (.env loaded)

  // Architecture decisions (5 — these will be approved)
  "Architecture decision: Allura uses dual-layer storage — PostgreSQL for episodic traces, Neo4j for canonical semantic insights. No direct agent writes to Neo4j.",
  "Architecture decision: Memory promotion follows SOC2 mode — all insights must pass curator scoring and human approval before activation in the graph.",
  "Architecture decision: RuVector serves as the primary retrieval backend for episodic memory with hybrid vector + BM25 search.",
  "Architecture decision: Scope resolution is implicit — every memory call carries tenant, group, project, agent, and session identity.",
  "Architecture decision: All memory operations are append-only. Updates create new versions with SUPERSEDES relationships; originals are deprecated, never deleted.",
