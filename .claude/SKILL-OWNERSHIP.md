**Total: 19 skills** — 5 Required (core gates), 14 Overlay (project-specific)

**No skills deleted.** All Allura skills have clear ownership, triggers, and no destructive overlaps.

**Special attention items:**
- `allura-memory-skill`: Mandatory for all agents. Cannot be removed without breaking Brain integration.
- `context7` + `multi-search`: Both serve Scout's discovery role. context7 for library docs, multi-search for web search. Complementary, not overlapping.
- `figma-*` skills: 6 Figma skills may seem excessive, but each serves a distinct Figma API surface. Keep all.
- Ralph-related: `ralph.md` is a command, not a skill. Ralph's execution is gated by the ContextScout + skill gate (R5).
