# /mcp-load

Load an approved MCP server and activate its tools.

## Usage

```
/mcp-load <server-id>
```

## Examples

```
 /mcp-load perplexica           # Load Perplexica self-hosted AI search
 /mcp-load exa                   # Load neural web search (if approved)
```

## How It Works

1. Validates server is in approved list
2. Checks environment variables (if required)
3. Invokes `mcp_add(server-id)` via MCP Docker Toolkit
4. Logs `MCP_LOADED` event to PostgreSQL
5. New tools become available immediately

## Prerequisites

- Server must be approved (via `/mcp-approve` or already in approved list)
- Environment variables must be set (if required)
- Perplexica is self-hosted — no API key required

## Result

```json
{
  "event": "MCP_LOADED",
  "server_id": "perplexica",
  "tools_available": [
    "mcp__MCP_DOCKER__perplexica_search"
  ]
}
```

**Note:** Loading is idempotent (safe to repeat).
